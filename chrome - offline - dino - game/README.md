# Chrome Offline Dino Game

## Project Overview
This is a project that imitates the dino game that appears when the Chrome browser is offline. The basic game logic is implemented through JavaScript, including functions such as the dino's jump and the movement of obstacles.

## Feature Highlights
1. **Dino Jump**: The dino can jump by pressing the spacebar (on a computer) or touching the screen (on a mobile device) to avoid obstacles.
2. **Obstacle Movement**: Obstacles move from the right to the left. When they move out of the left side of the screen, they will reappear on the right side.

## How to Use
1. Open a browser and visit the deployed link of the project (if it has been deployed to platforms like GitHub Pages).
2. On the page, press the spacebar (on a computer) or touch the screen (on a mobile device), and the dino will jump.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML**: Used to build the page structure and provide the game canvas.
- **CSS**: Sets the styles of the page and the game canvas.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the core game logic, such as the drawing of the dino and obstacles, state updates, and user interactions.

## Installation and Running (if you need to run it locally)
1. **Clone the project**: Run `git clone https://github.com/your_username/chrome - offline - dino - game.git` in the terminal.
2. **Open the project**: Open the cloned project folder using a text editor (such as Visual Studio Code).
3. **Run the project**: Simply open the `index.html` file in a browser to start the game.
